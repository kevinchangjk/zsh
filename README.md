## Making a new shell command

Running `mco <command>.sh` Takes a .sh file in the current folder and puts it into /usr/local/scripts, and then makes it executable.
That way, you can call the command from anywhere
```
mco script.sh
```

## managing .zshrc

The philosophy here is to make it easier to make things easier.

Hence these two aliases:
```
zshrc → nvim ~/.zshrc
reload → source ~/.zshrc
```
With `zshrc` I can open my `~/.zshrc` file from anywhere, and with `reload` I can re-source my configuration without having to leave and re-enter my terminal session.

## git shorthands

For git, I use [git number](https://github.com/holygeek/git-number). Running `git number` on its own resembles running `git status`, but this time with numbers beside each listed file.   
![asdf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10664455/114206166-a6a1eb80-998d-11eb-985e-7d13aab21467.png)

and so it's incorporated into my shorthands
```
gs → git number

ga → git number add
gaa → git add .
gr → git reset

gc → git commit
gcm → git commit -m
gca → git commit --amend -m
gb → git branch
gco → git number checkout

gd → git number diff
gu → git fetch && git status
```
#### less-used but still essential operations

Delete a local branch:
```
gb -d <branch name>
```

Delete a remote branch:
```
git push origin --delete <branch name>
```

A form of quickload (with last commit as quicksave):
```
gco .
```

Quickload, but just one file:
```
gco <file name>
```

## Navigating folders

For ease of navigating folders in terminal, I use aliases for `cd <directory>` too.
```
out → cd ..
back → cd -
home → cd ~/
```
To jump to commonly used folders, I use `2` followed by a shorthand of my destination folder, sometimes simply the first letter of the folders leading up to that folder.
```
2zsh → cd ~/Documents/Scripts/zsh/config
2vim → cd ~/.config/nvim
2qmk → cd ~/Github/qmk_firmware
2keeb → cd ~/Github/qmk_firmware/keyboards/dz60/keymaps/khang

2math → cd ~/Github/math/
2tex → cd ~/Github/math/web/diagrams/tex/
2bot → cd ~/Github/trading-bot
2learn → cd ~/Desktop/learn
2brew → cd ~/Github/brew-macOS

2uls → cd /usr/local/scripts
2dn → cd ~/Desktop/notes
2ds → cd ~/Documents/Scripts
2dzf → cd ~/Documents/Scripts/zsh/functions
```

## Path management

This is just how I like do it:
```
path+=('/usr/local/scripts')
path+=('/usr/local/scripts/tikz2svg-master')
path+=('/usr/local/Cellar/gcc@7')
path+=('/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin')
```

## Codeforces

Sometimes I go on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com), and occasionally I take part in contests. This section helps to quickly test my code.

I write code in `<problem number>.py` or `<problem number>.cpp`  and save the given input into `input_<problem number>.txt`, and then run them with
```
cnr <problem numebr>.cpp
pnr <problem number>.py

// cnr → compile and run
// pnr → python and run
```
